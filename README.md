TensorFlow recommends upgrading pip before install using pip

Use the command: pip install --upgrade pip


This project uses Keras 3.5.0 on top of TensorFlow.

Use the command: pip install --upgrade keras

Then use the command: pip install tensorflow


You can then run the python file, and as of this writing, it will begin to run the training.
